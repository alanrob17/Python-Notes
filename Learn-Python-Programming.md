# How to run a Python program

There are a few different ways in which you can run a Python program.

## Running Python scripts

Python can be used as a scripting language; in fact, it always proves itself very useful. Scripts are files (usually of small dimensions) that you normally execute to do something like a task. Many developers end up having their own arsenal of tools that they fire when they need to perform a task. For example, you can have scripts to parse data in a format and render it into another one; or you can use a script to work with files and folders; you can create or modify configuration filesâ€”technically, there is not much that cannot be done in a script.
